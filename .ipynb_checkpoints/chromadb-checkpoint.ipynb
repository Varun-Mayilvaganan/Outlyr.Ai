He was instrumental in the development of several missiles, including:\\n\\n1. **Agni**: a ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads\\n2. **Prithvi**: a surface-to-surface missile\\n3. **Trishul**: a short-range surface-to-air missile\\n4. **Nag**: an anti-tank missile\\n5. **Akash**: a medium-range surface-to-air missile\\n\\nDr. Kalam\\'s work on these missile projects earned him the nickname \"Missile Man of India\". He was also a key figure in the development of India\\'s space program, including the launch of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).\\n\\nIn addition to his scientific contributions, Dr. Kalam was also a dedicated educator and writer. He authored several books, including \"Ignited Minds\" and \"Wings of Fire\", which inspired many young Indians to pursue careers in science and technology.\\n\\nDr. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007, and was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India\\'s highest civilian honor, in 1997. He will always be remembered as a true patriot and a pioneer in India\\'s scientific community.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 363, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 403, 'completion_time': 1.8128849489999999, 'prompt_time': 0.011362521, 'queue_time': 0.0002919079999999987, 'total_time': 1.82424747}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c0cfa69934', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-4cfa2eca-7152-44c4-a3c5-fa91369e35a1-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 363, 'total_tokens': 403}\n"
